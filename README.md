# Final Project - Foundation Of Extended Reality

In this project, we developed an interactive memorial museum that aims to preserve and share the history of the Auschwitz concentration camps. The experience allows visitors to explore historical narratives, personal stories, photographs, and archival materials through an engaging and immersive digital interface. Our goal was to create a space for education, reflection, and remembrance, ensuring that the tragedies of the Holocaust are not forgotten while promoting awareness, empathy, and critical thinking about human rights and history.

We designed several interactive experiences within our museum to allow users to explore history in meaningful and diverse ways. Visitors can engage with the past by completing a torn map, opening a historical book, washing a boot, interacting with an old television, examining a piece of clothing worn by Auschwitz prisoners, or handling a replica gun. Each of these interactions and other features are described in detail below:

- **Map:** Users can drag the torn pieces of the Auschwitz camp map. Once completed, the full map is revealed along with additional historical information in the background.  
- **Notebook:** Users can open a notebook by dragging its cover to reveal the first page, which contains detailed information about the tragedies that occurred.  
- **Boot:** Users can take a sponge and scrub a soldier’s boot to uncover the blood stains of victims, offering a tangible connection to history.  
- **Lighting Control:** Upon entering the room, the lights automatically turn on, allowing users to clearly see and interact with the items in the space.  
- **Old TV:** Users can press a button on an old television to start a short video about the events of the time. A timer above the TV shows the remaining duration, and when paused, the timer is saved and hidden.  
- **Cloth:** Users can pick up clothing worn by concentration camp workers, which transports them to another scene where they learn about the number of people killed, providing a sense of the scale of one million lives lost.  
- **Gun:** Interacting with a gun transports users to a scene featuring an animation of a soldier executing a worker, along with an image of the actual location where this event occurred.
- **3D Audio**: The museum features immersive 3D audio that changes based on the user’s position and orientation. As users move closer to the sound source, the audio becomes louder, and turning or walking around alters how the sound is experienced.

## Team Members:
1. Daniyal Nasiri Bavil
   - **Role**: Designed the entire museum scene and developed interactions for the TV, Cloth, and Gun, as well as the 3D audio experience, and  Lighting system.
2. **Zeyu Liang**
   - **Role**: Developed interactions for the Boot washing, Notebook, and Torn-apart Map, and lighting system.
  
## Side Note:
- Since only one of our computers could run Unity smoothly, we primarily worked on the same laptop and pushed all changes to a single repository under the name of one person.
- The headset setup for our team experienced issues until the final week, preventing us from recording the full interactions using the headsets. As a result, we were only able to record the second video with the actual headset.
